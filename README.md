## Fetch Rewards - iOS Coding Challenge
### John Nimis


#### TO BUILD:
- this project uses Cocoapods for a single dependency, so run `pod install` inside the project folder before opening
- then use the `.xcworkspace` file, not the `.xcodeproj` file, as customary for Cocoapods

#### NOTES:
- I wrote a single unit test just to test my decoding logic
- the `ConstraintUtil` class is something I wrote that I use in my own projects, I didn't write it specifically for this assignemnt, I hope that's OK!
